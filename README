Hey Jim, 

The reason I handed this in a few days late is cause I was trying to work on the replace stale entry thingy for the arcade.
Since it'd be bad to hand in code after the date it was due, here's the code I had before the 15th

It works pretty well - it tells you anarchist quotes extracted from a site

Thanks, 
-Noah
